Run the `imadejptr` static site in a GitHub Codespace or any devcontainer.

- Open this repository in a Codespace. The devcontainer for the site lives at `imadejptr.github.io/.devcontainer`.
- The site folder has a `package.json` with a `start` script that serves the site on port `8080`.

Commands (in the Codespace terminal):

```bash
# (already run by devcontainer) npm install
npm start
```

Then open the forwarded port `8080` in the Codespaces Ports view or browser preview.
